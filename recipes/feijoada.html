    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine beans, onion, ham, calabresa, 3 cloves garlic, salt, cumin,
        black pepper, and bay leaf in a pressure cooker; cover with water to
        fill line.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according
        to manufacturer's instructions. Cook at high pressure until regulator is
        gently rocking, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce pressure to low. Cook, adding
        water halfway if needed, until beans are tender and water is reduced to
        your liking, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat. Let pressure release naturally according to
        manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock lid and remove. Let
        feijoada cool until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute remaining 1
        clove garlic and collard greens until just tender, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cassava flour in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
        until toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir in butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve feijoada with the collards-garlic mixture, toasted cassava flour,
        rice, orange wedges, and cilantro.
