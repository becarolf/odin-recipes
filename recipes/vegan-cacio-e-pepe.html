    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup raw cashews</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon miso paste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak cashews in boiling water. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, drain the cashews and blend until creamy. Add nutritional
        yeast, miso, and 1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper to the cashew
        cream. Add a bit of pasta water to thin it out as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1 cup of pasta water. Mix the spaghetti
        and sauce together, adding reserved pasta water if needed. The
        consistency should be thick enough that it will stick to the pasta.
        Plate and top each serving with olive oil and remaining black pepper.
        Serve immediately.
